# CPU-SCHEDULER
CPP program to visualize and analyze the CPU scheduling algorithms : <br />
- FCFS [First Come First Served] <br />
- RR [Round Robin] <br />
- SPN [Shortest Process Next] <br />
- SRT [Shortest Remaining Time] <br />
- HRRN [Highest Response Ratio Next] <br />
- FB-1 [Feedback with all queues have q=1] <br />
- FB-2^i [Feedback where q=2^i] <br />
- Aging <br />
  
The program reads the an input file from the user containing : <br />
1 - (trace: to visualize the process switching over cpu or stats: to show statistics about the scheduled processes) <br />
2 - CPU scheduling policy to be used with their parameters (if needed) <br />
3 - The ending time of the timeline <br />
4 -  The number of processes <br />
5 -  Description of each process containing (process name - Arrival time - service time) <br />
