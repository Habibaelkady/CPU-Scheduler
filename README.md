# CPU-SCHEDULER
CPP program to visualize and analyze the CPU scheduling algorithms :
FCFS [First Come First Served]
RR [Round Robin]
SPN [Shortest Process Next]
SRT [Shortest Remaining Time]
HRRN [Highest Response Ratio Next]
FB-1 [Feedback with all queues have q=1]
FB-2^i [Feedback where q=2^i]
Aging
  
The program reads the an input file from the user containing :
1-(trace: to visualize the process switching over cpu or stats: to show statistics about the scheduled processes)
2- CPU scheduling policy to be used with their parameters (if needed)
3- The ending time of the timeline
4- The number of processes
5- Description of each process containing (process name - Arrival time - service time)
